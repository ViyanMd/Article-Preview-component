## Acknowledgments

I enjoyed this challenge a lot. Even though it's simple, this challenge showed me the cool side of JS and what animations can do to your components. 
There's still a bug (or maybe not) with the button. In this version there's two different buttons for different layouts, because I didn't know what z-index was at the time. Anyways, maybe
I'll fix it, but it works exactly how I want it, so ... great challenge.
